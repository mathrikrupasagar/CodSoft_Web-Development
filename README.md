CodSoft Internship – Web Developer

I successfully completed my internship as a Web Developer at CodSoft, where I tackled various web development tasks that enhanced my technical skills and creativity.

Task 1: Portfolio Page Creation I developed a personal portfolio webpage that showcases my skills, experience, and projects. The page includes sections like About, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact, all structured with HTML and CSS. This task was instrumental in refining my front-end development capabilities and personal branding.

Task 2: Landing Page Development I designed a responsive and visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to apply fundamental web design concepts like layout structuring, sectioning, and design aesthetics. I focused on alignment, padding, and color coordination to ensure an intuitive user experience.

Task 3: Calculator Implementation I built an interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface and handling basic arithmetic operations through JavaScript. I utilized the CSS grid system for button alignment and incorporated event listeners and logic for accurate calculations.
